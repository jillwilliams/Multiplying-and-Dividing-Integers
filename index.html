        Multiplying and Dividing Integers

    <p>
        In math, an integer is defined as any positive or negative whole number. An integer is never a fraction or decimal.
        Example of Integers:  ... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        When multiplying or dividing positive and negative numbers, you must determine if the answer is positive or negative. This is sometimes very hard for students.<br>
        A pie chart symbol was created to give you a way to always get the right answer. It works with all multiplication or division problems.

    <p> 
        Using the pie chart is easy. For each number being multiplied or divided, shade one piece of the pie. If your number is positive, shade the piece with the plus sign in it. If your number is negative, choose one of the two pieces of the pie with the negative sign in it and shade it as well.
        <br><br>
        The unshaded piece of the pie is the sign of the answer; whether positive or negative. You will always have one piece of the pie unshaded. The negative piece of the pie unshaded means your answer is negative. The positive piece of the pie unshaded means your answer is positive. It's as easy as that!
